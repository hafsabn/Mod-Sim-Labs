# Modeling and Simulation Labs

This repository contains my work for the **Modeling and Simulation** course labs. Each lab explores a fundamental concept in modeling, simulation, and applied probability using Python.

## Lab Summary

###  Lab 1: Introduction Quiz
A conceptual quiz covering foundational topics in modeling and simulation, including key definitions, techniques, and theoretical underpinnings.

###  Lab 2: Python Basics
Hands-on practice with Python programming basics. Covered data types, control structures, functions, and essential libraries for simulation (e.g., `random`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`).

###  Lab 3: Probabilities and Random Number Simulation
Explored probability theory and implemented simulations using random number generation. Tasks included simulating dice rolls, coin tosses, and estimating probabilities.

###  Lab 4: Modeling Dynamical Systems
Studied how to model and simulate simple dynamical systems using difference equations. Simulated population growth and other time-evolving systems.

###  Lab 5: Monte Carlo Simulation
Applied the Monte Carlo technique to solve problems involving randomness and uncertainty. Simulations included estimating Pi, risk assessment, and integral approximations.

###  Lab 6: Stochastic Processes and Markov Chains
Implemented and analyzed stochastic processes, focusing on Markov Chains. Modeled systems with state transitions and steady-state analysis.

###  Lab 7: Discrete Event System Simulation
Modeled and simulated discrete-event systems such as queues and service systems. Used event scheduling techniques and tracked system performance metrics.
